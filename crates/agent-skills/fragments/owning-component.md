%% Delivered as a fragment: `design@agent-skills@shared-text-fragment`.
The project is partitioned into Components, which its manifest declares. The project's root is a
Component too.

1. Does the decision shape the layout of the project: which Components exist, and how they depend
   on each other? Then it belongs in the root Component's design home.
2. Does it shape how every Component is implemented: a design principle every Component follows?
   Then it belongs in the root Component's design home.
3. Does it shape how a single Component is implemented, or its own interface? Then it belongs in
   that Component's design home.

If it is a statement about what the project or a Component is _for_ rather than about how it is
built, it is a goal, not a decision. Goals are a register of their own, the goals home of each
Component, each entry a level-two heading carrying a slug. A decision that leans on one names it as
`goal@<component>@<slug>`.

If none of these fits, **ask the owner before writing it anywhere.**
